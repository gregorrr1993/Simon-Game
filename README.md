# Simon-Game

At start of each level, game shows you one button. To complete level you need to input whole sequence in right order.

Simple memory game in JavaScript with jQuery. Created during Udemy course The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp. Project called as second Boss Level Challenge. In first 1 min video was shown how complete site should work. Images, audio files, html and css was provided. I ignored all hints and wrote JS code independently. Additionally I eliminated two bugs which are present in exemplar website (https://londonappbrewery.github.io/Simon-Game/). After completing level it is possible to press one or two more buttons, the game over status is displayed, but new lvl function is executed anyway. In this code it results in starting at lvl 1, beacause in the meanwhile sequence array has been erased. Also you can lose game before it even started ;) All you have to do is to click one of the buttons, it results in game over.
